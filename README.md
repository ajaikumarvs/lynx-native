This repository is dedicated to creating a **native Android version of Lynx**, a **privacy-focused browser** developed using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. Unlike the original **Lynx browser**, which was built with **Tauri v2** for cross-platform support, this version is an entirely new codebase that implements the same core design and execution philosophy. This build does not aim to port existing features but focuses on reimagining the Lynx principles—**privacy**, **simplicity**, **efficiency**, and **scalability**—specifically for Android devices.

The goal is to provide a high-performance, privacy-conscious browsing experience optimized for Android, with a clean, modern codebase built to take full advantage of native Android capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-Focused**: Designed with user privacy in mind, ensuring a secure and private browsing experience.
- **Native Android Build**: Developed using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**, providing a fully native Android experience.
- **Simplicity & Efficiency**: Implements the Lynx philosophy of minimalism and efficiency, with a focus on fast, lightweight browsing.
- **Modern Codebase**: A fresh implementation with a clean, maintainable, and modern codebase optimized for Android devices.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with scalability in mind, allowing for easy future extensions.
